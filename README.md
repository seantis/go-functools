> _Quick: provide generic filter, map, reduce functions, before the Go team doesâ€¦_

This is a small library providing generic operations, such as Equal, Filter,
Map, Reduce, which are commonly used in many code bases.

This library most likely will be obsolete as the Go teams provides those
operations in the standard library.

Run the tests:

    go test
